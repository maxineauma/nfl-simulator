# NFL ELO Simulator

Nothing fancy, just a quick ELO simulator, but with NFL teams.
All ELO values can be found in ELO.json, these are based on their FiveThirtyEight ELO values for the 2022 pre-season.

(Will be updated for 2023 pre-season soon.)

Run `python nfl_simulate.py` to see what it's all about.
